# R-Project-MTH304
Using R, we were given the tasks to analyze different problems regarding probability theory and discrete distributions. Different visualizations were used to analyze these problems.  As a bonus, we were given a small dataset of students exam grades vs hours studied to find a trend of which students did the best in the exam.
